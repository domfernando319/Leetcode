Big O Analysis:
If nums[i] is 0, it is swapped with nums[left], 
and both left and i are incremented.

If nums[i] is 1, just increment i.

If nums[i] is 2, it is swapped with nums[right], 
and right is decremented.
i is not incremented in this case because the swapped value needs to be evaluated again

Best Case: O(n) 2s are already in place
Worst Case: O(2n) -> O(n) each swap requires a reprocess 


 If you need to sort an array with more than three distinct colors or categories, 
 the partitioning approach does become more complex.
 Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the different strategies and their implications:

1. Using a HashMap or Dictionary
For an arbitrary number of colors, a hashmap (or dictionary) can indeed simplify the problem:

Algorithm:
Traverse the array and count the occurrences of each color using a hashmap.
Rebuild Array: Iterate over the hashmap and reconstruct the array based on the counts.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
